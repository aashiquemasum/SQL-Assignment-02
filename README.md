SQL Server Management Studio provides functionality for managing every component of SQL Server. Use Management Studioto connect to:

An instance of the SQL Server Database Engine.

Analysis Services.

Integration Services.

Reporting Services.

Although Management Studio allows you to work with queries without first establishing a connection to a data source, most other tasks require a connection. Management Studioprovides the Connect to Server dialog box to configure connection properties to SQL Server components. When Management Studiostarts, it opens the Connect to Server dialog box and prompts you to connect to a server. The Connect to Server dialog box retains the connection settings from the last time it was used.
